# algorithms

This is a collection of algorithms I wrote as part of the course-work for Free Code Camp and Coding Dojo.  This has been an opportunity for me to tackle JavaScript challenges and learn more about various JavaScript methods.  All work published here is in-progress and suggestions for revision / improvement are more than welcome.

UPDATE: More algorithms are being added for practice -- these are attempts to work through LeetCode type problems or to add demonstrations of various data structures.
